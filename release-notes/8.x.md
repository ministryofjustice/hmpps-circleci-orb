# 8.8.0

Added `src/jobs/database_schema_report.yml` - generates a SchemaSpy report on a Postgres database running in docker in CircleCI 


# 8.7.0

New parameter `changelog_git_paths` added to the `deploy_env` job.  Normally the changelog when releasing shows all the changes for a project, but this option then allows this to be limited to a subset instead.  This is useful when working with multi project gradle builds so that when one of the subprojects is released the changelog is limited to that individual project.

# 8.6.0

New executor `src/executors/java_localstack_postgres_with_db_name.yml` added. This is similar to the existing `src/executors/java_localstack_postgres.yml` executor but allows the `postgres_db` to be passed in as well.  Note in the standard executor this defaults to the username but in this executor the default is `postgres` regardless.

# 8.0.0

## Breaking change

The JIRA orb now requires
```yaml
          pipeline_id: <<pipeline.id>>
          pipeline_number: <<pipeline.number>>
```
to be passed through to `build_docker`, `build_multiplatform_docker` and `deploy_env` jobs if `jira_update` is set to `true`.
If the values are not passed through, the Notify Jira task will succeed, but
```
Error posting payload to CircleCI for Jira Forge app
  HTTP Status: 202
  Errors:
[
  {
    "message": "'pipeline.id' is required"
  }
]
```
will appear in the logs and the JIRA ticket will not be updated with the deployment information.
