# 8.0.0

## Breaking change

The JIRA orb now requires
```yaml
          pipeline_id: <<pipeline.id>>
          pipeline_number: <<pipeline.number>>
```
to be passed through to `build_docker`, `build_multiplatform_docker` and `deploy_env` jobs if `jira_update` is set to `true`.
If the values are not passed through, the Notify Jira task will succeed, but
```
Error posting payload to CircleCI for Jira Forge app
  HTTP Status: 202
  Errors:
[
  {
    "message": "'pipeline.id' is required"
  }
]
```
will appear in the logs and the JIRA ticket will not be updated with the deployment information.
