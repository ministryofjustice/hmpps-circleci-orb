# 9.4.0
Re-introduce the --name attribute previously added in version 9.2.0 to fix an issue with having
docker layer cache enabled not working as intended with buildx command.

# 9.3.0

Revert 9.2.0 due to Circle error `name needs to start with a letter and may not contain symbols, except ._-`

# 9.2.0

Add --name attribute to the build_multiplatform_docker job `docker buildx create` step, to fix an issue with having
docker layer cache enabled with docker buildx command, but not correctly setting the name.

# 9.1.0

Allow `jdk_tag` to be passed through to veracode jobs, rather than hardcoding java 17.

# 9.0.0

## Breaking change

The deprecated Localstack options DEFAULT_REGION, DATA_DIR, TMPDIR and LAMBDA_EXECUTOR are no longer supplied to Localstack on all executors

This has been tested with Localstack v3.0.3, some older versions may not work correctly
