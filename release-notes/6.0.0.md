# 6.0.0

## Breaking change

The `docker_version` parameter has been removed.

As recommended by Circle any steps using the `setup_remote_docker` will now use Circle's default Docker version which should be very recent.

To fix your Circle build file, simply remove the `docker_version` for any of the following commands/jobs:
1. veracode_prepare_artifcats
2. build_docker
3. build_multiplatform_docker
4. publish_docker
5. trivy_latest_scan
6. trivy_pipeline_scan
