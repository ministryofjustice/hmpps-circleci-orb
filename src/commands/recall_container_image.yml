  in the environment) within the circleci workspace so that it can be used in
  a subsequent job.

  `persist_container_image` set to `true`.

  - attach_workspace:
      at: ~/app
  - run:
      name: Extract saved container image
      command: docker load --input docker_cache/build_image.tar
  - mem/recall:
      env_var: IMAGE_NAME
  - mem/recall:
      env_var: APP_VERSION
